This is not an implementation task — the user is asking how to access their existing database.

**Your database is already live on Lovable Cloud.** Every table, trigger, and function created through migrations is already deployed and running. There is no separate export step needed.

**To view your backend:**
- **Desktop**: Click the Cloud icon in the navigation bar above the preview. This gives you access to Database (tables, RLS policies), Users, Files/Storage, Edge Functions, and Secrets.
- **Mobile**: Tap the ellipsis (…) icon in the bottom-right corner → Cloud.

From the Cloud view you can:
- Browse all your tables and their data
- View Row-Level Security policies
- Manage secrets/environment variables
- See deployed edge functions
- Manage file storage buckets

If you need to connect to this database from an **external tool** (like a BI dashboard, Metabase, or a custom backend), you would use the database connection string available in your Cloud settings.
